the returns on stocks and bonds, <em>Journal of Financial Economics 33</em>

Factor Investing.

## Fama and French's Factor Model
<p>
This paper identifies five common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds. 

* 3 Stock Market factors:
1) Overall market factor
2) Factors related to firm size
3) Factors related to book-to-market equity
* 2 Bond Market factors
1) Factors related to maturity
2) Factors related to default risks

Stock returns have shared variation due to the stock-market factors, and they are linked to bond returns through shared variation in the bond-market factors.
Except for low-grade corporates, the bond-market factors capture the common variation in bond returns. 
<b>Most important, the five factors seem to explain average returns on stocks and bonds.</b>
</p>

## Notes on Portfolio chosen by factor.
<p>
The paper that Fama and French wrote introduces five common factors that best explains the average return on stocks and bonds.
Because this theory can be applied in the industry with ease, it quickly became the most over-used trading strategy in 
South-Korean financial industry. 
</p>

<p>
Today, top 5 brokerage companies and top asset management companies utility Fama and French's 
factor model to sort out their monthly portfolios. Those who tries to escape from the repetitive analysis come up with 
bizarre model called Macro-Dynamic Model.
</p>

### Variant 1. Macro Dynamic Model
<p>
Then, what <em>exactly</em> is a Macro-Dynamic Model. Macro Dynamic Model that many of the South-Korean asset management 
company claim to use, starts with the proposition that the Macro-Economic situation we are witnessing today can be a repetition
of the Macro-Economic situation we've already witnessed some time ago. The similarity between the macro economic situation 
can be measured with distance measuring formula.(Euclidean, Correlation, you name it) 
</p>

<p>
After the model finds the closest period that is most similar with the current situation, it chooses factors that gives 
maximum returns with the portfolio. After that, the model automatically concludes that the chosen factor will also be
effective in current situation(since the macro situation is similar), and propose entities for long-short portfolios.
Brokerage 'S' claims that this kind of Macro-Dynamic Model is effective because the model automatically decides the best 
factor without the input of human.
</p>

<p>
At an instant, one can find logical flaws in the overall system. What if the world is looking at completely different 
macro economic environment? What factors would you use then? One report states that the economic situation is similar to 
that of mid 2017s, because "the average of the distance score of some macro economic variables were similar to that of 2017s".
However, how can we prove that some unforeseen variable might be lurking beneath the macro dynamic model? Or how can we prove
that the model is using too much variable, that it hinders the process of finding the most similar economic state?
</p>

<p>
Also, the model relies on the proposition that the effect of the factor is same in the past.
